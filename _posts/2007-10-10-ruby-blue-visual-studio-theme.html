<p>Now that I'm blogging again, and I've had a resurgence of .NET related posts, I thought I'd add to a meme I saw going around earlier this summer. First John Lam posted his <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/vibrant_ink_vis.html">Vibrant Ink</a> theme for Visual Studio, then I saw Tomas Restrepo post his <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2007/09/11/NightingaleAVS2005ColorScheme.aspx">Nightingale</a> theme.</p>
<p>I've always been a fan of John Long's <a href="http://wiseheartdesign.com/2006/3/11/ruby-blue-textmate-theme/">Ruby Blue TextMate</a> theme. So I created my own Visual Studio theme (including the Monaco font) a long time ago and thought I should <a href="http://blowmage.com/assets/2007/10/10/RubyBlueTheme.zip">share it here</a>. Enjoy.</p>
