Okay, so its been a couple years. So what? Big deal. What is a short 768
day hiatus between friends? The good news is that my [Ruby
podcast](https://archive.org/details/RubiversePodcast/) is back. And not just one episode back.
I’ve published three episodes recently with with Brian Ford, Nathan
Esquenazi, and Wayne Seguin. I’m really happy with them and excited for
a future with many more interesting conversations.

[I spoke with Wayne
Seguin](https://archive.org/details/RubiversePodcast/rubiverse-11-wayne-seguin-on-rvm-and-bdsm.mp3)
about his über popular [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) and his
plans to rewrite it using his up and coming [BDSM
framework](http://bdsm.beginrescueend.com/). BDSM is interesting because
it provides a bit more structure to the default shell environment and in
my mind holds the promise that more can contribute to RVM. I expect
great things from this in the future.

[I spoke with Nathan
Esquenazi](https://archive.org/details/RubiversePodcast/rubiverse-10-nathan-esquenazi-on-padrino.mp3)
about the [Padrino](http://www.padrinorb.com/) web micro-framework and
its take on creating modular web applications. I’m excited for more
modularity in our web apps, and think Padrino is on the right track.

[I also spoke with Brian
Ford](https://archive.org/details/RubiversePodcast/rubiverse-9-brian-ford-on-rubinius.mp3) about the
history and future of [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/). Rubinius seems to
be on the verge of tipping over and being a viable Ruby implementation
for mainstream applications. I’m very excited for this and hope that the
release of 2.0 pushed it over the edge.

This is just the start. I’m committed to more conversations with
interesting Rubyists. Who would you like to hear from? Let me know and
I’ll make it happen.
