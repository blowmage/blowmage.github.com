[RubyConf 2012](http://rubyconf.org/) is coming up. I will be there, and I'd love to hang out with you. You should come. It'll be fun. And if you are coming, you need to train. Fortunately its easy enough to do. Just type the following:

    $ gem install escape_to_rubyconf
    $ escape_to_rubyconf

So not many know this, but I spoke on Writing Games with Ruby at RubyConf 2010. This game is the end product of my session. I figured it would be fun to throw it in a gem and release it. So here it is!

There were unfortunate problems with the recording of my session, and I've been working with Confreaks to recreate it for the video. But one thing led to another and the [video](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/490-rubyconf2010-writing-games-with-ruby) still isn't finished. You can download a rough cut though. Let me know what you think.
