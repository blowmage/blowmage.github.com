<p>We&#8217;re in the midst of <a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/">MountainWest RubyConf 2008</a>, and I have lots I want to blog about it. But before I get there, and before I take a 36 hour nap, I just want to let you know how nice Ruby folk are. This may be a fairly simple example, but I want to share it anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of the organizers of the conference, and that has meant that I miss about half the conference sessions because I&#8217;m running around trying to fix the power or fix the wifi or organize the distribution of food. On Friday we had a really delicious lunch from <a href="http://www.rumbi.com/">Rumbi&#8217;s</a>, but it left the conference room we ate in rather messy. We paid a cleaning deposit, but the trash needed to be collected and the room straightened. I was informed of this just as we were breaking for dinner and I told them we would fix it before the evening session. I ended up stressing over this for the entire dinner break because I hate the idea of inconveniencing the great people at the <a href="http://www.slcpl.lib.ut.us/locations.jsp?parent_id=8&#38;page_id=20">Salt Lake City library</a> who have been so accommodating towards the 200 geeks who descended upon them destroying their power circuits and their wifi.</p>
<p>I got back from dinner just 20 minutes before the evening session, and called out to the ~30 folks milling around in the foyer asking for help cleaning the room up.  We had ~8 people in the room and had the whole thing straightened up in under 5 minutes. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>And to add to this, as we left at the end of the day I asked if everyone could pick up their empty water bottles. After chatting with some folks I walked out and the entire auditorium was cleaned out. Not a water bottle in site. Now this may seem like two very small things, but this means the world to me. It shows respect for the venue and I appreciate it very much. Thanks guys!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had so much fun at the conference this year. I&#8217;ve fully enjoyed meeting new people and talking with everyone I&#8217;ve been able talk with. We have a wide variety of folks attending this year; from the mind-bendingly smart gurus to the total noobs. But everyone is getting along and helping each other become better. Not just better technically in regards to Ruby, but I honestly believe that we are helping each other become better people as well. There is a great vibe here, I wish everyone could experience it.</p>
<p>I know we set the bar pretty high last year, but I think we on our way to being even better this year.</p>
