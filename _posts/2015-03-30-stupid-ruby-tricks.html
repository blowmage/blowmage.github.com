<p>I like Ruby. Since you are reading this I assume you also like Ruby. Ruby is great. And you are great. What better way to show our appreciation to Ruby than to discuss some stupid ruby tricks like I did at <a href="https://ruby.onales.com/">Ruby on Ales 2015</a>.</p>

<p>Shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/jsullivandigs">Josh Sullivan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/fittyfent">Colton Fent</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kobier">Coby Randquist</a> for organizing the conference and inviting me. They are the ones who made this happen. They are the real villans here, not me.</p>
