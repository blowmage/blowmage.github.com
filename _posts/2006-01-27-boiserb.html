<p>Well, I finally did it. I started a user group for Ruby. I'm very excited about it, and I hope those who attend will be half as enthused about it as I am.</p>
<p>I expect that the Boise Ruby Brigade (boise.rb for short) group will be two parts <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, two parts <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, and one part <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a>.</p>
