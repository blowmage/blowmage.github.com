<p><a href="http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/craigshoemaker/">Craig Shoemaker</a> of the <a href="http://polymorphicpodcast.com/">Polymorphic Podcast</a> has just posted <a href="http://polymorphicpodcast.com/shows/objectthinking/">part one</a> of his interview with author Dr. David West about his book Object Thinking.  Craig contacted me a few months ago about <a href="http://blowmage.com/2005/09/20/object-thinking">my review of Object Thinking</a> and asked if I had any questions for Dr. West.  Boy do I.</p>
<p>Here is the list of questions I sent Craig:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is formalist thinking and why is it bad? It seems like such a good fit when dealing with computers.</li>
<li>Why is OOP/object thinking so hard to get right? Besides making everyone read your book, how can help change a formalist culture to object thinking? Not just an individual's understanding, but the culture as a whole - like a corporate IT culture.</li>
<li>Where are the future object thinkers coming from today? Methodology? (Agile? XP?) Languages? (Ruby? Python?)</li>
<li>Are programming languages important? Where are we in regards to object-oriented languages? What is missing? Where do future languages need to go? Is formalist thinking reflected in language design? (I believe so.) What are the best examples of hermeneutic languages?</li>
<li>How did you end up with Microsoft Press as a publisher? The book was Microsoft-agnostic, and it seemed like a strange fit to me.</li>
<li>(Unsure about this question) Was the book successful? How was it received?</li>
<li>What is Dr. West doing now? Teaching? Research? Slinging code?</li>
<li>Does he have a blog? If not, why not?!? Seriously, he needs a blog! He is depriving the work of much needed object thinking by not having a blog.</li>
</ul>
