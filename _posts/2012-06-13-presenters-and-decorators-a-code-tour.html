<p>I gave a session titled "<a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/884-railsconf2012-presenters-and-decorators-a-code-tour">Presenters and Decorators: A Code Tour</a>" at <a href="http://railsconf2012.com/">RailsConf 2012</a>. The Presenter and Decorator patterns are very useful approaches to keeping your Rails apps clean. I wanted to talk about presenters for a couple of reasons. First, I think we don't talk about the View layer in our Model-View-Controller apps as much as we should. And second, I think that although "Presenters" have been around for <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2007/03/rails-presenter-pattern.html">5+ years</a>, we continue to misunderstand them.</p>

<p>On my list of career goals is to speak at RubyConf and RailsConf. I spoke at RubyConf in 2010, and this year I completed the second half of my goal. I can't thank the good folks at <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a> enough for giving me the chance to speak, and for partnering with <a href="http://confreaks.com/">Confreaks</a> to record it and make it freely available.</p>
